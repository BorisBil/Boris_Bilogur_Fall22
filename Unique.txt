THERE WAS A CORRUPTED FILE IN OLD REPO, THIS IS THE NEW AND ACCURATE REPO

In this game, you are chased by enemies while attempting to collect as many hearts as you can.
Collect the hearts while dodging the Windows logo and the later-spawning flower. 

Unique features:
  Both enemies chase your character based on vector calculations
  First "easier" enemy chases you from the start, "harder" faster enemy spawns when 10 hearts are collected
  Player character has hitpoint system
  "Star" item spawns once for every 7th heart collected
  Collecting the "star" grants you an additional hitpoint
  If enemy hits player character while player character has more than 1 hitpoint, the game continues and the enemy is respawned away from the player
  If enemy hits player character while player character only has 1 hitpoint, the game ends
